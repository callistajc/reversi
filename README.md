# **Reversi with Minimax AI**

Welcome to the Reversi project with a Minimax algorithm for the computer AI! This React TypeScript implementation allows you to play the classic game of Reversi (also known as Othello) against a computer opponent that utilizes the Minimax algorithm for decision-making.


### **Introduction**

Reversi is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid. The objective is to have the majority of your color discs on the board at the end of the game. Players take turns placing discs of their color on the board, with the opponent's discs being flipped when a line of one's own discs is surrounded.

This project enhances the Reversi experience by implementing a computer opponent using the Minimax algorithm. Minimax is a decision-making algorithm widely used in two-player turn-based games to find the optimal move.


### **Features**
- Classic Reversi gameplay.
- Challenging computer opponent using the Minimax algorithm.
- Built with React and TypeScript.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.


### **How to Play**
1. Run the game.
2. Make your moves by selecting a valid position on the board.
3. Watch the computer opponent use the Minimax algorithm to make strategic moves.
4. The game ends when the board is full or no player can make a valid move.
5. The player with the most discs of their color on the board wins!


### **Minimax Algorithm**
The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. In the context of this Reversi project, the computer AI uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate possible moves and select the one that maximizes its chances of winning.


### **GitHub Pages**
The Reversi project is now available online through GitHub Pages. You can play the game without the need for any local installation. Simply follow the link below:
